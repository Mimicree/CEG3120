# Project 0 - Git Guide

In your repo for this course, create a folder named `git-guide` with a file named `README.md`. In this file, write up a quick guide to using git & GitHub. For each command, include a brief definition of what it does, and a sample of how to use it. `status` has a sample of what a well done filled in entry looks like.

You may use markdown to format this in a way that is clean for you.  If you would prefer tables, you can make tables in markdown.

Entries that are currently crossed out we will get to later in the course.  You are welcome to revisit this guide and add details to it.

Your repository must demonstrate usage of each of the below.  For example, I can go to your repository and see an additional branch besides "main"

## Command line git

- status
  - Shows status of the local repository. This status includes:
    - number of local commits that have not been synced with remote (GitHub)
    - list of files in local folder than are NOT being tracked by git
    - list of files in local folder that have changes that need to be committed
  - `git status`
- clone
- add
- rm
- commit
- push
- fetch
- merge
- pull
- branch
- checkout
- init
- remote

## git files & folders

Provide descriptions of expected contents and what these are used for

- .git folder
- .gitignore file
- ~~.git/hooks~~

## GitHub

Provide basic how-to-use guides for both.  This should be short and sweet so that you can refer to it as a quick guide.

- Pull requests
- SSH authentication to repositories
- ~~Actions~~

## Resources
Other resources are welcome, just cite them (you can do lazy citations here, or use markdown to make links throughout your guide)

- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
