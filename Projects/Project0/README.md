# Project 0 - Git Guide

In your repo for this course, create a folder named `git-guide` with a file named `README.md`. In this file, write up a quick guide to using git & GitHub. For each command, include a brief definition of what it does, and a sample of how to use it. `status` has a sample of what a well done filled in entry looks like.  For some commands, we can visually demonstrate that you have played with them in order to brush up your skills.  For each topic that should be viewable in your repository, there will be a note added of what the denomstrated element will be that we are checking for.

You may use markdown to format this in a way that is clean for you.  If you would prefer tables, you can make tables in markdown.

Entries that are currently crossed out we will get to later in the course.  You are welcome to revisit this guide and add details to it.

## Command line git

- status
  - Shows status of the local repository. This status includes:
    - number of local commits that have not been synced with remote (GitHub)
    - list of files in local folder than are NOT being tracked by git
    - list of files in local folder that have changes that need to be committed
  - `git status`
- clone
- add
- rm
- commit
  - **DEMONSTRATE** Your GitHub repo should have a commit history of more than one.  Commit messages should state changes at points in time
- push
- fetch
- merge
  - **DEMONSTRATE** A commit in your GitHub history should have a standard message that content was merged.  Sample:
    - `Merge branch 'main' of github.com:WSU-kduncan/ceg3120f23-pattonsgirl`
- pull
- branch
  - **DEMONSTRATE** Your GitHub repo should have more than the `main` branch.  We can switch to the other branch and see content that may not be synced to `main`
- checkout
- init
- remote

## git files & folders

Provide descriptions of expected contents and what these are used for

- .git folder
- .gitignore file
  - **DEMONSTRATE** Your GitHub repo should contain a `.gitignore` file that shows you are ignoring a set of files (or a folder) to prevent accidentally tracking them
- ~~.git/hooks~~

## GitHub

Provide basic how-to-use guides for both.  This should be short and sweet so that you can refer to it as a quick guide.

- Pull requests
  - **DEMONSTRATE** Generate and complete a Pull Request in your repository in GitHub.  Pretend you are two people.
- SSH authentication to repositories
- ~~Actions~~

## Resources
Other resources are welcome, just cite them (you can do lazy citations here, or use markdown to make links throughout your guide)
