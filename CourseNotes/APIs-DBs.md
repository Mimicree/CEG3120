## APIs

REST API (Application Programming Interface), you'll commonly see HTTP requests sent by the client **to** servers to perform a service:
- GET - request info
- POST - send info (new record)
- PUT - update info (existing record)
- DELETE - remove entry

In a RESTful API, the client sends these requests to the server, and the server interprets them and performs the request.

CRUD APIs are another common term:
- C = Create
- R = Read
- U = Update
- D = Delete

This [guide by programming historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-apis-with-python-and-flask) has a great APIs 101 overview.
